Here is a shot of an Embedded Asset Manager being edited:

Press "Extract and Explore" to view the contents:

Add your artwork or other files to your Asset Manager.  You
can also create directories.  Go wild!  Here's a simple example,
using some of my favorite free icons, the Silk set:

Once you've added your assets to the folder, you can press
"Export New Module" and create a new Asset Manager...

...Complete with your assets and a self-contained ability to edit
the repository:

And when you "run" your new repo in stand-alone mode, you can add
new content, remove files, edit files in place...whatever.  Just
re-encode when you're done.
